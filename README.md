# PokemonCatcher
Solution to PokemonCatcher problem for PremiumMinds

COMPILE

To compile all classes simply use the following command in the project folder:
	javac solver/*.java Main.java

RUN

To run the program use the following command in the project folder:
	java Main

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS

I have implemented two different solutions. The source code is running the first and simpler one.
To run the second one, compile the alternative main with "javac HashMain.java" and run with "java HashMain".
The second version was an attempt at a better algorithm but has some disadvantages that are listed in the source code of the HashSolver.java class.
If only one version is to be considered, I believe the first one is more consistent.
